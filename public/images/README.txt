IMAGE GUIDE - The Natural Ones Website
=============================================

Add your images to this folder with these exact names:

LOGO (appears in nav, hero, and footer):
  logo.png - Your group logo (recommended: square, min 200x200px)

SHOW POSTER (appears in The Show section):
  poster.jpg - Your show poster image

GROUP PHOTO (appears in About section):
  group-photo.jpg - A photo of your group/cast

CAST PHOTOS (appear in The Party section):
  cast/member1.jpg - First cast member
  cast/member2.jpg - Second cast member
  cast/member3.jpg - Third cast member
  cast/member4.jpg - Fourth cast member
  cast/member5.jpg - Fifth cast member
  cast/member6.jpg - Sixth cast member

TIPS:
- JPG or PNG formats work best
- Square photos work best for cast members (they display as circles)
- If an image is missing, a fallback icon/text will display instead
- To add more cast members, edit src/App.jsx
